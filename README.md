# Presidential Debates Analysis

This is meant to be a fun personal project to practice python, matplotlib, and maybe some machine learning.

# todo some of the files indicate speaker with period instead of colon

### Possible sources of error:
- Some speakers have been given different titles over different debates, and I need to match up different titles to different speakers manually. This is also more difficult because speakers are marked with a ":", and colons are commonly used throughout the entire text.
- Many instances of dialogue are marked by crosstalk and unknown speakers.
- I have encountered many misspellings in the transcript
- At least one of the hyperlinks on the ucsb website was linked to the wrong page.
