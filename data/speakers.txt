q. president. romney
gov. romney. thank you, kerry, for your question. it's an important one, and i think the president just said correctly that the buck does stop at his desk, and he takes responsibility for that
syria
so we're going to make sure that people we trade with around the world play by the rules. but let me not just stop there. don't forget
ms. crowley. mr. president, we have a really short time for a quick discussion here
gov. romney. the answer is very straightforward
i believe governor romney is a good man, loves his family, cares about his faith. but i also believe that when he said, behind closed doors, that 47 percent of the country considered themselves victims, who refuse personal responsibility, think about who he was talking about
and the answer is, yes, we can help, but it's going to take a different path, not the one we've been on, not the one the president describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich; that's not what i'm going to do. my plan has five basic parts
now, i'm concerned that the path that we're on has just been unsuccessful. the president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran 4 years ago
the second area, taxation. we agree we ought to bring the tax rates down, and i do
and finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, i'm not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the revenues going to the government. my number-one principle is there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit. i want to underline that
now, i talked to a guy who has a very small business. he's in the electronics business in st. louis. he has four employees. he said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes
the president. jim, i‚Äîyou may want to move on to another topic, but i would just say this to the american people
mr. lehrer. and the question is this
what things would i cut from spending? well, first of all, i will eliminate all programs by this test if they don't pass it
the president. when i walked into the oval office i had more than a trillion-dollar deficit greeting me, and we know where it came from
we went after medical fraud in medicare and medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars
now, we all know that we've got to do more, and so i put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan. it's on a website; you can look at all the numbers
governor romney earlier mentioned the bowles-simpson commission. well, that's how the commission‚Äîbipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward, suggested we have to do it
gov. romney. you said you'd cut the deficit in half. it's now 4 years later; we still have trillion-dollar deficits. the cbo says we'll have a trillion-dollar deficit each of the next 4 years. if you're reelected, we'll get to a trillion-dollar debt. but you have said before you'd cut the deficit in half. and this four‚Äîi love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts
but you know if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why, that $2.8 billion is on the table. of course, it's on the table. that's probably not going to survive if you get that rate down to 25 percent. but don't forget, you put $90 billion‚Äîlike 50 years' worth of breaks‚Äîinto solar and wind
so my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term. and in medicare, what we did was, we said we are going to have to bring down the costs if we're going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that, let's look where some of the money is going
one last point i want to make
and the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state
and the question is this
the role of government
mr. lehrer. all right, let's go through some specifics in terms of what‚Äîhow each of you views the role of government. how do‚Äîeducation
mr. lehrer. oh, well, no. but the fact is, government‚Äîthe role of government and governing‚Äîwe've lost a pod, in other words. so we only have 3 minutes left in the debate before we go to your closing statements. and so i want to ask, finally, here‚Äîand remember, we've got 3 minutes total time here. and the question is this
this is a‚Äîthis is an important election, and i'm concerned about america. i'm concerned about the direction america has been taking over the last 4 years. i know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals. it's bigger than our respective parties. it's an election about the course of america

brokaw
question
obama
mccain
but understand this
when you announce that you're going to launch an attack into another country, it's pretty obvious that you have the effect that it had in pakistan
and the question in this election is
thank you. brokaw
lehrer
but let's be clear
now, john mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and he's absolutely right. here's the problem
so you may end up getting a $5,000 tax credit. here's the only problem
let's give every american a choice
now, look, we all would love to lower taxes on everybody. but here's the problem
and i saw that, and i saw the situation, and i stood up, and i voted against that, because i was afraid that they couldn't make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred marines would make a difference. tragically, i was right
on october 2, next thursday, also at 9
ifill
palin
biden
and let me just ask a rhetorical question
there -- with new technology, with tiny footprints even on land, it is safe to drill and we need to do more of that. but also in that "all of the above" approach that senator mccain supports, the alternative fuels will be tapped into
but here's the bottom line, gwen
we will change this policy with thoughtful, real, live diplomacy that understands that you must back israel in letting them negotiate, support their negotiation, and stand with them, not insist on policies like this administration has. ifill
the only authority the vice president has from the legislative standpoint is the vote, only when there is a tie vote. he has no authority relative to the congress. the idea he's part of the legislative branch is a bizarre notion invented by cheney to aggrandize the power of a unitary executive and look where it has gotten us. it has been very dangerous. ifill
schieffer
i will ask both of you
i think everybody understands at this point that we are experiencing the worst financial crisis since the great depression. and the financial rescue plan that sen. mccain and i supported is an important first step. and i pushed for some core principles
what the american people can't afford, though, is four more years of failed economic policies. and what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about what's most pressing to them
the question is this

and we will begin with the fight against the coronavirus. president trump, the first question is for you. the country is heading into a dangerous new phase. more than 40,000 americans are in the hospital tonight with covid, including record numbers here in tennessee. and since the two of you last shared a stage, 16,000 americans have died from covid. so please be specific

this debate is sponsored by the commission on presidential debates. the commission has designed the format
clinton
i have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the supreme court. but i feel that at this point in our country's history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse roe v. wade, that we stand up against citizens united, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say
trump
and, you know, look, i understand that donald's been strongly supported by the nra. the gun lobby's on his side. they're running millions of dollars of ads against me. and i regret that, because what i would like to see is for people to come together and say
you know, i've had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country. i've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in china, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in romania. and i can tell you
i have been for border security for years. i voted for border security in the united states senate. and my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security. but i want to put our resources where i think they're most needed
and donald knows a lot about this. he used undocumented labor to build the trump tower. he underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do
he has no respect for her. he has no respect for our president. and i'll tell you what
your running mate, governor pence, pledged on sunday that he and you‚Äîhis words‚Äî"will absolutely accept the result of this election." today your daughter, ivanka, said the same thing. i want to ask you here on the stage tonight
while millions have already voted, election day, november 8th, is just 20 days away. one thing everyone here can agree on
quijano
kaine
i'll just say this
pence
but i have to tell you, i just ‚Äî i was listening to the avalanche of insults coming out of senator kaine a minute ago. kaine
but there are other parts of the world that are challenging. let me tell you this
moderators
raddatz
cooper
question
when i hear something like that, i am reminded of what my friend, michelle obama, advised us all
holt
the 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long. we'll explore three topic areas tonight
i will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates
now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the great depression. and believe me
we are in a big, fat, ugly bubble. and we better be awfully careful. and we have a fed that's doing political things. this janet yellen of the fed. the fed is doing political‚Äîby keeping the interest rates at this level. and believe me
but i like to remember what michelle obama said in her amazing speech at our democratic national convention
let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by donald, first, nato. you know, nato as a military alliance has something called article 5, and basically it says this
and i will tell you this, lester
and i know donald's trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but i hope the people out there understand

senator, i want to set the stage for this discussion by asking the question that i think hangs over all of our politics today and is probably on the minds of many people watching this debate tonight, and that is
the measurement is not
so we can do a better job of homeland security. i can do a better job of waging a smarter, more effective war on terror and guarantee that we go after the terrorists. i will hunt them down, and we'll kill them. we'll capture them. we'll do what's ever necessary to be safe. but i pledge this to you, america
senator kerry. i'll tell you exactly how i can do it
president bush. well, his rhetoric doesn't match his record. he's been a senator for 20 years. he voted to increase taxes 98 times. when they tried to reduce taxes, he voted against that 127 times. he talks about being a fiscal conservative or fiscally sound, but he voted over‚Äîhe voted 277 times to waive the budget caps, which would have cost the taxpayers $4.2 trillion. he talks about pay-go‚Äîi'll tell you what pay-go means when you're a senator from massachusetts, when you're a colleague of ted kennedy
the fact is that he's cut job training money. a billion dollars was cut. they only added a little bit back this year because it's an election year. they've cut the pell grants and the perkins loans to help kids be able to go to college. they've cut the training money. they've wound up not even extending unemployment benefits and not even extending health care to those people who are unemployed. i'm going to do those things because that's what right in america
what i'm saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions
we also wanted medicare to be able to negotiate bulk purchasing. the va does that. the va provides lower cost drugs to our veterans. we could have done that in medicare. medicare is paid for by the american taxpayer. medicare belongs to you. medicare is for seniors who are‚Äî many of them‚Äîon fixed income, to lift them out of poverty. but rather than help you, the taxpayer, have lower cost, rather than help seniors have less expensive drugs, the president made it illegal‚Äîillegal‚Äîfor medicare to actually go out and bargain for lower prices. result
president bush. two things
senator kerry. you don't measure it by a percentage increase. mr. president, you measure it by whether you're getting the job done. five hundred thousand kids lost after-school programs because of your budget. now, that's not in my gut. that's not my value system‚Äîand certainly not so that the wealthiest people in america can walk away with another tax cut
i've said it before; i say it again
let me just make it clear
tonight's format is going to be a bit different. we have assembled a townhall meeting. we're in the "show me" state, as everyone knows missouri to be, so missouri residents will ask the questions, these 140 citizens who were identified by the gallup organization as not yet committed in this election. now, earlier today each audience member gave me two questions on cards like this
he talks about a grand idea
the president stood right here in this hall 4 years ago, and he was asked a question by somebody just like you
president bush. that's an odd thing to say since we've tripled the homeland security budget from 10 to 30 billion dollars. listen, we'll do everything we can to protect the homeland. my opponent is right
other ways to make sure drugs are cheaper
and finally, he says he's going to have a novel health care plan. you know what it is? the federal government is going to run it. it is the largest increase in federal government health care ever, and it fits with his philosophy. that's why i told you about the award he won from the national journal. that's what liberals do
senator kerry. let me begin by saying that my health care plan is not what the president described. it is not a government takeover. you have choice
now, i'm going to restore what we did in the 1990s, ladies and gentlemen
i'm pledging i will not raise taxes. i'm giving a tax cut to the people earning less than $200,000 a year. now, for the people earning more than $200,000 a year, you are going to see a rollback to the level we were at with bill clinton, when people made a lot of money. and looking around here at this group here, i suspect there are only three people here who are going to be affected
president bush. let me start with how to control the costs of health care
president bush. let me make sure you understand my decision. those stem cell lines already existed. the embryo had already been destroyed prior to my decision. i had to make the decision
president bush. he complains about the fact our troops don't have adequate equipment, yet he voted against the $87 billion supplemental i sent to the congress and then issued one of the most amazing quotes in political history
saddam hussein was a risk to our country, ma'am. and he was a risk that‚Äîand this is where we just have a difference of opinion. the truth of the matter is, if you listen carefully
senator kerry. not necessarily be in power. but here's what i'll say about the 87 billion
tonight i had a chance to discuss with you what to do to keep this economy going
i have a better plan for homeland security. i have a better plan to be able to fight the war on terror
i'm proud that important military figures are supporting me in this race
my message to our troops is
senator kerry. secretary of state colin powell told this president the pottery barn rule
i will make a flat statement
now, prime minister allawi came here, and he said the terrorists are pouring over the border. that's allawi's assessment. the national intelligence assessment that was given to the president in july said
i know that for many of you sitting at home, parents of kids in iraq, you want to know, who is the person who could be a commander in chief who can get your kids home and get the job done and win the peace? and for all the rest of the parents in america who are wondering about their kids going to a school or anywhere else in the world, what kind of world they're going to grow up in, let me look you in the eye and say to you

our point in this is not complicated
he said that -- made mention of this global test. what john kerry said -- and it's just as clear as day to anybody who was listening -- he said
and we see the result of there not being a coalition
it's awfully hard to convey a sense of credibility to allies when you voted for the war and then you declared
we stood up and said
they have a plan for iraq too
that is not the way to win friends and allies. you're never going to add to the coalition with that kind of attitude. ifill
you've missed a lot of key votes
here's what's happened
and i want everyone to hear this, because there have been exaggerations made on the campaign trail
i want to read something you said four years ago at this very setting
(laughter) cheney
we have double-digit inflation in health care costs. we've seen the largest rise in medical costs in the last four years in the country's history
the threats we face
here are the judgments i would make
we want to raise the active-duty forces by 40,000, double the special forces so we can find terrorists where they are, and provide the kind of support for families -- health care, housing -- that they deserve while their loved ones are serving and protecting us. ifill
he is ready to be commander in chief. ifill
now, flip-flops
they said that they were going to do something about health care in this country. and they've done something
this president said -- i listened to him the other night at his 2000 debate saying
here's the truth
a reminder
